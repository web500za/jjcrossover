## Opportunity #1: CRM Platform Optimization (Salesforce)

### Summary Title
**Salesforce License Optimization & Contract Renegotiation**

### Current State
- **Vendor:** Salesforce UK Ltd
- **Annual Spend:** $3,117,226 (37% of total vendor spend)
- **Issue:** Single largest vendor by significant margin; likely over-provisioned licenses

### Explanation
Salesforce represents over one-third of total vendor spend. This concentration presents both risk and opportunity:
- Enterprise CRM contracts typically include 15-30% unused or underutilized licenses
- Multi-year contracts often lock in higher rates that can be renegotiated
- Duplicate functionality may exist with HubSpot ($32,187) which should be eliminated

### Recommended Actions
1. Conduct license utilization audit to identify inactive/underused seats
2. Consolidate to appropriate license tiers (Enterprise → Professional where applicable)
3. Eliminate HubSpot overlap - migrate any unique functionality to Salesforce
4. Renegotiate contract with competitive pressure from Microsoft Dynamics

### Estimated Annual Savings
**$450,000 - $650,000**
- License optimization (15% reduction): $467,000
- HubSpot elimination: $32,000
- Contract renegotiation (additional 5%): $156,000

## Opportunity #2: Office Space & Real Estate Consolidation

### Summary Title
**Global Workspace Portfolio Rationalization**

### Current State
Multiple overlapping office space and coworking vendors across geographies:

| Vendor | Annual Spend | Location |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Tog UK Properties Limited | $263,821 | UK |
| Zagrebtower D.O.O. | $183,754 | Croatia |
| Innovent Spaces Private Limited | $147,348 | India |
| Weking D.O.O. | $144,093 | Croatia |

| Work Easy Space Solutions | $14,913 | India |
| **TOTAL** | **$955,651** | |

### Explanation
The company maintains fragmented real estate relationships across 8+ vendors in multiple countries. This fragmentation leads to:
- Reduced negotiating leverage with individual providers
- Inconsistent employee experience across locations
- Administrative overhead managing multiple contracts
- Missed volume discount opportunities

### Recommended Actions
1. Consolidate to 2-3 strategic global workspace partners (e.g., WeWork, Regus/IWG)
2. Negotiate master services agreement with volume discounts
3. Evaluate owned vs. leased space strategy for mature markets
4. Implement hybrid work policy to reduce per-employee space requirements

### Estimated Annual Savings
**$280,000 - $380,000**
- Vendor consolidation (20% efficiency): $191,000
- Volume discount (10% additional): $95,000
- Hybrid work space reduction (10%): $96,000

| **TOTAL** | **$564,520** | |

### Explanation
The company engages 10+ accounting and advisory firms globally, resulting in:
- Duplicated audit and compliance work
- Inconsistent financial reporting standards
- Premium rates due to lack of volume commitment
- Knowledge fragmentation across providers

### Recommended Actions
1. Select single global audit firm (Big 4 or top-tier) for all statutory audits
2. Consolidate tax advisory under one global provider with local expertise
3. Establish preferred supplier agreements with volume commitments
4. Reduce reliance on boutique advisory for standard compliance work

### Estimated Annual Savings
