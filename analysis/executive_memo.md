# EXECUTIVE MEMO

**TO:** CEO & CFO
**FROM:** VP of Operations
**DATE:** January 21, 2026
**RE:** Vendor Spend Analysis & Cost Optimization Recommendations

---

## Summary

Following comprehensive analysis of our vendor portfolio (400+ vendors, ~$8.5M annual spend), I have identified **$1.0M - $1.5M in achievable annual savings** through strategic vendor consolidation and contract optimization. These savings represent **12-17% of current spend** with minimal operational disruption.

---

## Key Findings

**Spend Concentration:** Our largest vendor, Salesforce, represents 37% of total spend ($3.1M). This concentration presents significant optimization opportunity.

**Vendor Fragmentation:** We maintain relationships with 400+ vendors, many serving overlapping functions:
- 8+ office space providers across regions
- 10+ accounting and advisory firms
- 5+ health insurance providers
- Duplicate vendor entities (e.g., two Navan accounts)

**Non-Essential Spend:** Approximately $150K annually flows to non-core vendors (entertainment, team activities, wellness programs) that can be eliminated or significantly reduced.

---

## Top 3 Recommendations

### 1. Salesforce License Optimization | Savings: $450K-$650K
Conduct license utilization audit and renegotiate contract. Eliminate HubSpot overlap. Enterprise contracts typically carry 15-30% underutilized capacity.

**Action Required:** Authorize IT and Procurement to begin Salesforce audit immediately.

### 2. Office Space Consolidation | Savings: $280K-$380K
Consolidate from 8+ workspace providers to 2-3 strategic global partners. Negotiate master services agreement with volume discounts. Current fragmented approach ($956K across providers) sacrifices leverage.

**Action Required:** Direct Real Estate to develop RFP for global workspace partnership.

### 3. Professional Services Rationalization | Savings: $140K-$200K
Consolidate 10+ accounting and advisory relationships to single global audit firm with local delivery capability. Current fragmentation ($565K) creates inefficiency and premium pricing.

**Action Required:** Engage Procurement to evaluate Big 4 proposals for global engagement.

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Actions | Expected Savings |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Immediate | Month 1-2 | Terminate non-essential vendors, merge duplicate accounts | $100K |
| Short-term | Month 3-6 | Salesforce audit, office space RFP, insurance consolidation | $400K |
| Medium-term | Month 6-12 | Contract renegotiations, professional services consolidation | $500K |

---

## Next Steps

I recommend we proceed with the following immediate actions:

1. **Approve vendor termination list** (45 vendors, $175K annual spend) for non-essential services
2. **Commission Salesforce license audit** through IT department
3. **Issue RFP for global workspace partnership** through Real Estate
4. **Schedule quarterly vendor review** to track optimization progress
