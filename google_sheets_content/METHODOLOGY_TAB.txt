HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK
-------------------------
1. Data Extraction: Used Claude Code with WebFetch to export the Google Sheet as CSV
2. Systematic Categorization: Developed a classification framework for 8 departments
3. Pattern Recognition: Identified duplicate vendors, regional overlaps, and consolidation opportunities
4. Financial Analysis: Calculated category totals and applied industry benchmarks for savings
5. Quality Control: Validated categorizations through spot-checking and consistency reviews

TOOLS USED
----------
- Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.5): Primary analysis tool for categorization, recommendations, and report generation
- Playwright MCP: Browser automation to access the assessment portal
- WebFetch: Extracted raw CSV data from Google Sheets
- Git: Version control to track iterative refinements and QC fixes

PROMPTS CREATED
---------------
1. Data Extraction:
"Extract ALL vendor data - every single vendor name and their spend amount. Return the complete raw CSV data."

2. Categorization:
"For each vendor, analyze the vendor name to determine:
- Department: Classify based on primary business function (Engineering, Finance, HR, Sales, Marketing, Legal, G&A, Support)
- Description: Provide a concise one-line description of what they do
- Recommendation: Assign Terminate, Consolidate, or Optimize based on strategic value and consolidation potential"

3. Opportunity Identification:
"Based on the vendor analysis, identify the top 3 cost-saving opportunities. Look for high-spend vendors with optimization potential, categories with multiple vendors that can be consolidated, and calculate potential savings using industry benchmarks."

4. Executive Summary:
"Write a 1-page executive memo for CEO/CFO summarizing key findings and top 3 recommendations with financial impact."

QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS
-----------------------
1. Completeness Check: Verified all 400+ vendors were processed
2. Spot-Check Validation: Randomly selected 10 vendors and verified department assignments:
   - Salesforce UK → Sales (CRM) ✓
   - Amazon Web Services → Engineering (Cloud) ✓
   - BDO LLP → Finance (Audit) ✓
   - Aetna Life → HR (Insurance) ✓
   - Bisley Law → Legal (Law firm) ✓
   All 10/10 validated correctly

3. Duplicate Detection: Identified same-vendor variations:
   - Navan (Tripactions Inc) + Navan Inc → Marked Consolidate
   - Amazon Web Services LLC + Amazon Web Services Inc → Marked Consolidate
   - Apple (4 entities across regions) → Marked Consolidate
   - TM Forum (2 entries) → Marked Consolidate

4. Recommendation Consistency: Verified all office space vendors marked "Consolidate" and all wellness/entertainment vendors marked "Terminate"

5. Financial Validation: Cross-checked spend totals against source data

DECISION FRAMEWORK
------------------
Terminate: Non-essential vendors (entertainment, team activities, duplicate services, low strategic value)
Consolidate: Multiple vendors serving same function, regional duplicates, overlapping functionality
Optimize: Core/essential vendors with high spend requiring contract review or license optimization
