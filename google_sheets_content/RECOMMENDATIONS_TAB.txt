EXECUTIVE MEMO

TO: CEO & CFO
FROM: VP of Operations
DATE: January 21, 2026
RE: Vendor Spend Analysis & Cost Optimization Recommendations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY

Following comprehensive analysis of our vendor portfolio (400+ vendors, ~$8.5M annual spend), I have identified $1.0M - $1.5M in achievable annual savings through strategic vendor consolidation and contract optimization. These savings represent 12-17% of current spend with minimal operational disruption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY FINDINGS

Spend Concentration: Our largest vendor, Salesforce, represents 37% of total spend ($3.1M). This concentration presents significant optimization opportunity.

Vendor Fragmentation: We maintain relationships with 400+ vendors, many serving overlapping functions:
• 8+ office space providers across regions
• 10+ accounting and advisory firms
• 5+ health insurance providers
• Duplicate vendor entities (e.g., two Navan accounts, two AWS accounts)

Non-Essential Spend: Approximately $150K annually flows to non-core vendors (entertainment, team activities, wellness programs) that can be eliminated or significantly reduced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Salesforce License Optimization | Savings: $450K-$650K
Conduct license utilization audit and renegotiate contract. Eliminate HubSpot overlap. Enterprise contracts typically carry 15-30% underutilized capacity.
ACTION REQUIRED: Authorize IT and Procurement to begin Salesforce audit immediately.

2. Office Space Consolidation | Savings: $280K-$380K
Consolidate from 8+ workspace providers to 2-3 strategic global partners. Negotiate master services agreement with volume discounts. Current fragmented approach ($956K across providers) sacrifices leverage.
ACTION REQUIRED: Direct Real Estate to develop RFP for global workspace partnership.

3. Professional Services Rationalization | Savings: $140K-$200K
Consolidate 10+ accounting and advisory relationships to single global audit firm with local delivery capability. Current fragmentation ($565K) creates inefficiency and premium pricing.
ACTION REQUIRED: Engage Procurement to evaluate Big 4 proposals for global engagement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Terminate non-essential vendors, merge duplicate accounts | $100K savings
Phase 2 (Month 3-6): Salesforce audit, office space RFP, insurance consolidation | $400K savings
Phase 3 (Month 6-12): Contract renegotiations, professional services consolidation | $500K savings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT STEPS

1. Approve vendor termination list (45 vendors, $175K annual spend) for non-essential services
2. Commission Salesforce license audit through IT department
3. Issue RFP for global workspace partnership through Real Estate
4. Schedule quarterly vendor review to track optimization progress
